			<p>Our story started in the end of 2006, when a group of developers and designers trying to create a blog aggregator. It was a successful attempt. They got it right, peoples accept their presence and also their blog aggregator. Many bloggers saying they love it, so do the blog readers since they can know the updates in one place.</p>
			<p>And the epic story continue to prosper..</p>
			<p>*   *   *</p>
			<p><em>Until one day...</em></p>
			<p>The lead developer said, "<em>We shall use a new technology and platform for this blog aggregator!</em>". All team members agreed since they taught it is for the future development and growth. The user interface designer come out with design mockups for the new &amp; shiny blog aggregator. But the lead developer replied, "<em>We need more than that, please...</em>" </p>
			<p>Until they realized it, it's been 2 years they kept <strong>restructuring</strong>, <strong>reorganizing</strong>, and <strong>redesigning</strong> the new &amp; shiny blog aggregator. But to make it more tragic, the main site is sometimes(read as always) down due to the so-called development phase. This let other developer to come out with a new blog aggregator, social bookmaking sites, that slowly fading out the blog aggregator that they develop before in the eyes of lovers, bloggers, and more importantly, the readers.</p>
			<p>So, at the end, one of the original members of that group slowly lost an interest to grow it further. He just think that <strong>it is not worthy to develop a things that users had lost their faith in it</strong>.</p>
			<p>*   *   *</p>
			<p><em>Luckily, he is not alone...Not at all...</em></p>
			<p>One wise guy approach him, lending him a hand to stand back. He said, "<em>Let us start a new one, but this time, we must have a mission to guide us!</em>"</p>
			<p>The guy who lost his interest in development replied, "<em>Is having a mission can make me smile again?</em>"</p>
			<p>The wise guy reply, "<em>Yes boy, having a mission is like having a dream. You have a dream, don't you?</em>"</p>
			<p>The guy in the sorrow start to smile again. Now he remembered what things that he need to accomplish.</p>

			<p>Story ends... ^_^</p>
			<p>p/s: Don't take this story too seriously, I just made it more epic than the real one.</p>
